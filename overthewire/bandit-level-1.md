## Initial Reconnaissance

### Target Information
- **Current User**: bandit1
- **Home Directory**: /home/bandit1
- **Target File**: `-` (hyphen)

### Tools Used
- cat command
- ls command

### Commands/Steps
```bash

```

## Methodology

### Step 1: List Directory Contents
First, check what files are in the current directory.

**Command/Code:**
```bash
ls -la
```

**Output:**
```
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 May  7  2020 .
drwxrxr-x 41 root root 4096 May  7  2020 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  220 May 15  2017 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3526 May 15  2017 .bashrc
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  675 May 15  2017 .profile
-r--------  1 bandit2 bandit1   33 May  7  2020 -
```

### Step 2: Read the File
The file is named `-` (hyphen). To read it, we need to specify the full path or use a special syntax.

**Command/Code:**
```bash
cat ./-
```

**Output:**
```
[REDACTED]
